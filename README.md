# tabla-db
spring web app to store tabla lessons online in a database instead of a book

This app is designed to store pieces of tabla music, specifically Kaidas, consisting of a theme, paltas, tihais and possibly gats. All of these sequences of bols are named "compositions", which are stored within "pieces".
